# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
<n> <b>  What is AIRBNB? </b>  </n>

Airbnb is a leading platform where people can book beds, apartments, and homes around the world. It allows the hosts to rent out their places at their convenience.Through Airbnb, people can find places to stay even in areas where there is a likelihood of fewer hotels.

<n> <b>  Project Goals </b>  </n>

1, Study the Airbnb data for New York City

2, Visualize how the Prices and ratings vary across different neighborhoods

3, How do the categories and other different variables influence the price and ratings?

4, How can we represent the available data in a meaningful pattern

5, How useful insights could be derived from the data


## Process
### STEP 1:
    Download the dataset from the given drive (the link was provided in the GIT repository)
### STEP 2:
    Try to understand the relation between the features and average price, by virtualizing each feature and average price.
### STEP 3:
    Carried out Analysis and plotted visuals on the following:

	    - Neighborhoods that have steady growth levels based on average price

 	    - Neighborhoods constant growth based on average price by the property type

	    - Maximum number of reviews varied based on the price ranges

	    - Relation between the average price of the properties and the number of hosts (by neighborhood)

	    - Percentage share - property types by room types

	    - Different correlations derived using Host Type

	    - Clustering & Forecasting â€“ Model results

## Results
I selected to perform Option 2 using the Airbnb dataset to plot the visuals and perform EDA and derive meaningful insights and outcome. Based on the above analysis mentioned, I formulated the following questions for which i have answered in my Tableau visualizations for which I have attached a PDF file with all the dashboards containing my Tableau Visuals.

<n> <b> 1. Which are the neighborhoods that show a steady growth level among the given ones based on the Average Price ?</b>  </n>

Bronx was showing higher growth and later became steady as compared to Staten Island. Staten Island which had a steep growth in 2012, unfortunately dropped in 2013, though it picked up again in 2014 and slashed down again in 2015 among all the neighborhoods, which means this neighborhood was pretty unstable.

While Queens and Brooklyn have a steady growth in the average price in the neighborhood, neither they had a huge raise nor a steep fall making them a steady neighborhood amongst others. However Manhattan had a good start based on the average price but had several fluctuations and the average price reduced by 2015.
